Pest Monitoring and Control System

Introduction

The Pest Monitoring and Control System is a smart solution designed to automatically detect, monitor, and help control pest populations in agricultural environments, particularly greenhouses. By leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning models like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, this system enables real-time pest detection and early intervention to protect crops and improve yields.
